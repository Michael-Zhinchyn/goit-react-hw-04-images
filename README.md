# REACT home-work 04 task 3

## (Image Gallery Refactor)

A refactored version of my previous Image Gallery Home Work project,
transitioning from class-based components to functional components using React
Hooks.

## Overview

This project aimed to enhance the readability and performance of the previous
version of the Image Gallery. By leveraging React Hooks, the codebase has become
more concise and easier to maintain.

## Features

- **Functional Components**: Transitioned from class-based components to
  functional components for a cleaner and more modern approach.
- **React Hooks**: Implemented `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` for
  state management and side effects.
- **Performance Improvements**: Enhanced the performance by optimizing render
  cycles and reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- **(Any other features you've added or enhanced)**

## Changes Made

- Refactored all class-based components to functional components.
- Removed the lifecycle methods and replaced them with the `useEffect` hook.
- Optimized the scroll event listener with the `useCallback` hook.
- **(List any other significant changes you made)**

## Lessons Learned

Refactoring the project taught me the advantages of using functional components
over class-based components, especially in terms of readability and code
optimization.
